And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public.\
Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures;and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round meand take stock of my progressand position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life.\
Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regardedand hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame.\
It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of goodand ill which divideand compound man’s dual nature.\
In this case, I was driven to reflect deeplyand inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religionand is one of the most plentiful springs of distress.\
Though so profound a double - dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; \
I was no more myself when I laid aside restraintand plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering.\
And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mysticand the transcendental, reactedand shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members.\
With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moraland the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck : \
that man is not truly one, but truly two.I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point.\
Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines;and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruousand independent denizens.\
I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one directionand in one direction only.\
It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thoroughand primitive duality of man; \
I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both;\
and from an early date, even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements.\
If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirationsand remorse of his more upright twin;and the just could walk steadfastlyand securely on his upward path,\
doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgraceand penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil.\
It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.\
How, then were they dissociated ?" };
